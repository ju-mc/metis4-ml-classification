# Metis Module 4: Machine Learning Classification

The goal of this project was to identify and explore features of mushrooms that are correlated with poisonousness. 
I found that using only a few features, you could confidently identify poisonous mushrooms (with 99.8% accuracy and perfect precision + recall). 
These features are odor, gill size, and spore print color. Additionally, odor alone can also produce a highly accurate model (with 98% accuracy and 98% ROC).
